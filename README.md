# Introduction

Imagine you are training a machine learning model on your company server, and unexpectedly, the power goes off! Now, the model that you have spent the whole afternoon training on is gone. You realize that you have lost your chance of getting a promotion this year. As data scientist whose life depends on the supply of electricity, we are curious about the driving factors that cause major power outages with high severity.

This project will investigate the relationship between economic performance, measured by Gross State Product(GSP), and the severity of major power outages, measured by outage duration in minutes in the United States from January 2000 to July 2016. The major outages are defined by the Department of Energy as those affecting at least 50,000 customers or causing an unplanned firm load loss of at least 300 MW. Each row in the dataset describes a specific event of a major power outage. There are in total 56 columns and separated into 7 major categories. They are Time, Geographical information, causes, consumption, customer population, economic outcome, and land use characteristics

Considering the fact that industrial customers require the highest amount of energy and their output can be directly represented by the states' GSP statistic. A robust GSP statistic may indicate a state's capacity to invest in and maintain critical infrastructure, potentially reducing the severity and duration of power outages. Conversely, states with weaker economic performance may experience longer outage times due to less well-made infrastructure.

Therefore, the central question for this study is: whether a state's GSP is a significant factor that contributes to the severity of power outages. This analysis will be vital to multiple parties, including policymakers and utility companies. The findings of the project will act as strong evidence for them to impose strategic investments in states' infrastructure to contribute to the propersity of the states. However, as the project progresses, the guiding question may evolve in response to emerging data patterns. For example, we might specifically focus on the proportion of GSP contributions made solely by the utility industries of each state.
