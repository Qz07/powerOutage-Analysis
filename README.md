# powerOutage-Analysis

Imaging you are tranining a machine learning model on your company server, unexpectingly, the power goes off. Now, the model that you has spent whole afternoon tranining on is gone. You realize that you have lost your chance of getting promotion this year. As a data scientist whose life depends on the supply of electricity, we are curious about the driven factors that cause large power outage with high severity.

The dataset records the major power outage from 2000 to 2016 across U.S. Each row in the dataset describes a specific event of major power outage. There are in total 56 columns and separated into 7 major categories. They are Time, Geographical information, causes, consumption, customer population, economic outcome, and land use characteristics

Accoridng that some of our data science questions are:
- Is there a postive correlation between the industrial customer population and duration of power outage
- Is the power outage duration mainly depends on the climate and geographical condition in different areas
- Will the increasing in population density cause the increasing in power outage duration since the it will take them more time to get more electricity

Among all the customers, industrial customers requires the groups that reuqires the highest amount of energy...Our question is: What is the relationship between regional economic characteristics and the severity of major power outages
